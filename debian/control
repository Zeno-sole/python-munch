Description: dot-accessible dictionary similar to JavaScript objects - Python 3.x
 Munch is a fork of David Schoonoverâ€™s Bunch package, providing similar
 functionality. 99% of the work was done by him, and the fork was made
 mainly for lack of responsiveness for fixes and maintenance on the
 original code.
 .
 Munch is a dictionary that supports attribute-style access, a la
 JavaScript.
 .
 This package contains the library prepared for Python 3.x.
